The process involved a combination of calculations, normalization, and scaling to ensure fairness and accuracy in comparing players.\n","\n","* I started by defining the mid-range area as shots taken from 10 feet to the three-point line. Using this definition, I aggregated the percentage of field goal attempts taken from two ranges—10-16 feet (%FGA_10-16) and 16 feet to the three-point line (%FGA_16-3P)—into a new metric, %FGA_10-3P. This allowed me to evaluate a player's reliance on mid-range shooting as a percentage of their overall shot attempts. Next, I calculated the combined field goal percentage for the mid-range (FG%_10-3P) by weighting each range’s field goal percentage by its respective shot volume. This weighted approach provided a more accurate measure of mid-range efficiency.\n","\n","* To quantify scoring output, I calculated the average points scored per game from mid-range shots (PTS_Mid) by multiplying mid-range field goal attempts, field goal percentage, and a factor of 2 (since each mid-range shot is worth two points). I then extended this metric across the total number of games played to determine the total points scored from mid-range (Total_PTS_Mid). This gave a cumulative view of each player’s mid-range contribution throughout the season.\n","\n","* Since total mid-range points can vary significantly depending on playing time and shot volume, I normalized this metric using MinMaxScaler, creating a scaled version (PTS_Mid_Scaled) that fits within a 0 to 1 range. This ensured that comparisons between players were not biased by raw totals alone. Finally, I adjusted the existing “Middy Score” metric by multiplying it with the scaled mid-range points (PTS_Mid_Scaled), producing the final Pts_Adj_Middy_Score. This composite score reflects both efficiency and volume, providing a balanced measure of mid-range scoring performance.\n","\n","* This process allowed me to distill multiple aspects of mid-range scoring—volume, efficiency, and game-to-game contributions—into a single, interpretable metric. By combining advanced calculations with normalization techniques, I ensured that the analysis was both comprehensive and equitable, making it easier to compare players across different playing styles and contexts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"603dd2d6","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.011959,"end_time":"2024-12-10T04:01:23.254524","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-10T04:01:23.242565","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["###

To calculate the Defensive Score, I began by selecting a set of key metrics that best represent a player's defensive impact. These included both basic per game statistics, such as defensive rebounds (DRB), steals (STL), blocks (BLK), personal fouls (PF), season totals for shooting fouls committed (ShootFoulCmtd), and offensive fouls drawn (OffFoulDrawn), as well as advanced metrics like defensive rebounding percentage (DRB%), steal percentage (STL%), block percentage (BLK%), defensive win shares (DWS), and defensive box plus-minus (DBPM). Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive view of a player's defensive contributions.\n","\n","* To ensure that each metric contributed equally to the final score, I normalized their values to a common scale of 0 to 1 using the MinMaxScaler from the sklearn library. Normalization was essential because these metrics have different units and ranges, which could otherwise skew the results. By scaling the data, the lowest value in each metric became 0, and the highest value became 1, allowing for fair comparisons across metrics.\n","\n","* Once the data was normalized, I calculated the Defensive Score by taking the mean of the normalized values for each player across all selected metrics. This approach gives equal weight to all metrics, ensuring that no single statistic dominates the score. The result is a single numeric value on a 0 to 1 scale that represents a player’s overall defensive performance, with higher scores indicating stronger defensive contributions.\n","\n","* This process was straightforward yet effective. It allowed me to distill complex and diverse defensive metrics into an interpretable and balanced score. By avoiding arbitrary weights and ensuring fairness through normalization, the Defensive Score provides a transparent and meaningful way to evaluate and compare players' defensive impacts."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":6254597,"sourceId":10134454,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30804,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":9.170478,"end_time":"2024-12-10T04:01:24.443563","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-12-10T04:01:15.273085","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
