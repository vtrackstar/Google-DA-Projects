Final Insights\n","* In this project, I leveraged K-means clustering to categorize NBA players into distinct offensive archetypes based on their playing style and court positioning data from Basketball-Reference. The archetypes include scoring guards, playmaking guards, and balanced guards, as well as iso wings, catch-and-shoot wings, and balanced wings. For bigs, the clusters consisted of back-to-the-basket bigs, stretch bigs, and balanced bigs.\n","* By analyzing the percentage of time each player spends at a particular position, I found that 68 out of 262 eligible players (at least 8 games played in the 2024-25 season) fit the \"catch and shoot wing\" archetype. This insight reflects trends in modern basketball, where certain archetypes, like catch-and-shoot wings, are prevalent due to the evolving nature of the game.\n","* It's important to note that factors like injuries and the growing trend of positionless basketball played a role in some clustering outcomes, such as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder being categorized as a wing despite traditionally being a point guard.\n","* This analysis showcases my ability to apply clustering techniques and interpret real-world data, while also critically analyzing the results to account for complexities like player injuries and team dynamics."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":6152036,"sourceId":9995491,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":6152175,"sourceId":9995738,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30786,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":10.44906,"end_time":"2024-11-24T19:41:18.974386","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-11-24T19:41:08.525326","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
